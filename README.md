# Live Translation — Real-Time Multilingual Audio for Presentation Rooms

Real-time speech translation for live presentations. A **speaker** talks in one
language; each **listener** hears it in the language *they* choose — with
interpreter-style latency. Each room has **one QR code that everyone scans** —
speaker and audience alike — then each person picks their role and language.
One speaker per room, unlimited listeners.

- **Same language** (e.g. Hindi → Hindi): audio is relayed raw — no AI, lowest latency (~100–150ms).
- **Different language** (e.g. English → Hindi): `Speech-to-Text → (Translate) → Text-to-Speech`.
- **Top priorities:** accuracy and latency.

Powered by [Sarvam AI](https://www.sarvam.ai) (Saaras STT, Bulbul TTS, text-translate),
behind a provider-agnostic layer so other engines (e.g. Bhashini) can be swapped in later.

## How it works

The server is a thin **WebSocket relay**. Browsers capture mic audio, downsample
to 16kHz PCM16, and stream binary frames. The server fans audio out to listeners
and orchestrates translation pipelines.

**Core efficiency rule:** at most **one** translation pipeline runs per distinct
listener-language per room — its output is fanned out to *every* listener of that
language, regardless of how many there are. 100 Hindi listeners = 1 pipeline.

### Routing (4 cases)

| Speaker | Listener | Path |
|---------|----------|------|
| Hindi   | Hindi    | Raw WebSocket relay, no AI |
| English | English  | Raw WebSocket relay, no AI |
| Hindi   | English  | Saaras STT `translate` → Bulbul TTS |
| English | Hindi    | Saaras STT `transcribe` → text-translate → Bulbul TTS |

> Rule: a non-English Indic speaker → Saaras `translate` gives target English in
> one call. An English speaker → transcribe, then text-translate to the target.
> Every translated path ends at Bulbul TTS, so all listeners share one PCM16 player.

## Measured latency

Real numbers from a local English → Hindi demo (16 utterances, `GET /metrics`):

| Stage | What it measures | median (p50) | p95 |
|-------|------------------|-------------:|----:|
| STT | you stop talking → transcript | 455 ms | 1245 ms |
| Translate | English text → Hindi text | 172 ms | 367 ms |
| TTS | Hindi text → first audio chunk | 434 ms | 587 ms |
| **End-to-end** | **you stop talking → listener hears Hindi** | **1087 ms** | **1855 ms** |

Same-language relay is ~100–150ms. Numbers are from a single laptop (localhost);
real networks add ~100–300ms.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (developed on v25)
- A Sarvam AI API key — sign up at [sarvam.ai](https://www.sarvam.ai) (₹1000 free credits)

### Setup
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # then paste your key into SARVAM_API_KEY
```

`.env`:
```
SARVAM_API_KEY=your_key_here
PORT=3000
```

### Run
```bash
npm start        # or: npm run dev  (auto-restart on file changes)
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — the **room dashboard**. Click **Create** to mint a
room (unique code + QR); you're taken to its QR screen (`host.html`). Everyone
scans the same QR → `join.html` → pick **Speaker** or **Listener** + a language.
Rename or delete rooms from the dashboard; deleting disconnects everyone in it.
A listener is kept to **one room per browser** (joining another evicts the first).

For quick local testing you can also jump straight in:

- **Speaker:**  http://localhost:3000/speaker.html?room=main
- **Listener:** http://localhost:3000/listener.html?room=main
- **Metrics:**  http://localhost:3000/metrics

Pick a language in each tab, **Go Live** on the speaker, **Listen** on the
listener. For translation, choose *different* languages in the two tabs.

> **On one machine, use headphones** on the listener tab — otherwise the speaker
> mic picks up the playback. Across separate devices this isn't an issue.

## Observability

| Endpoint | What it gives you |
|----------|-------------------|
| `GET /health` | liveness check (`{ ok, uptime }`) |
| `GET /metrics` | per-stage latency aggregates (avg / p50 / p95 / min / max) per room+language |
| `GET /cost` | exact billable usage (STT seconds, TTS/translate chars) × configurable rates |

Cost rates are placeholders — set the real Sarvam values via env (no redeploy):
`SARVAM_STT_RATE_PER_MIN`, `SARVAM_TTS_RATE_PER_1K_CHARS`, `SARVAM_TRANSLATE_RATE_PER_1K_CHARS`, `SARVAM_CURRENCY`.

## Deployment (Easypanel / Docker)

The repo ships a `Dockerfile`. HTTPS is **required** in production (browsers block
microphone access without it) — the client auto-uses `wss://` when served over HTTPS.

**On Easypanel:**
1. Create an app from this GitHub repo, branch `phase-4-qr-multiroom` (or your deploy branch).
2. Build method: **Dockerfile**. App port: **3000**.
3. Add environment variables:
   - `SARVAM_API_KEY` = your key (required for translation; the repo never contains it)
   - optionally the `SARVAM_*_RATE_*` cost vars above
4. Attach your domain — Easypanel provisions HTTPS automatically. WebSockets pass
   through its proxy by default; the app's 30s heartbeat keeps them alive.
5. Open the domain → **Host a room** → share the QR with your audience.
